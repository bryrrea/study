Welcome to this repository! I'm creating this repo to track my learning and maybe to help someone that is beginning to study programming and web development.  
Some of the material in this repository will be very basic and are things that I already know and am recapping, but I will still post them to help someone. Everyone has a beginning, and no one should be ashamed of it.  
This README will be used as a Summary Table to help everyone to find specific files and subjects.  
I hope it will be of great value to anyone who needs it! Enjoy it! o/
