# 3. Loops and Packing

## 3.1. Loops

Loops are structures that allows you to execute the same block of code more than once.

### 3.1.1. The for loop

The for loop is used with countable loops. It is commonly called "repetition structure with a variable of control". Below, we have the syntax to write a for loop.

```javascript
for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
  code block;
}
```

Let's brake the code above:

-   **"`let index = 0`"** is creating a variable called `"index"` and it is starting with the value (index) "0" (almost all programming languages starting the index from zero).
-   **"`index < array.length`"** is a boolean structure to check if a condition is true or false.
-   **"`index++`"** is incrementing the variable `"index"` by one unit. It can be incremented by more than one unit if you want.

### 3.1.2. While loop

The **while loop** is used when we have uncountable loops. It is commonly called a **"repetition structure with a logical test"**, since we need to start a variable outside the loop and increment (or decrease) it to work. Let's see it syntax below:

```javascript
initializing variable
while (logical test with initializing variable) {
  code here
}
```

A variable is logically tested and a piece of code will run as long as that logic is `true` (or `false` in some cases). Let's see an example:

```javascript
let points = 100;

while (points > 100 === false) {
    console.log(points + " is lower than 100.");

    points--;

    if (points < 0) {
        break;
    }
}
```

In the code above, I started a variable called "points" and the loop will run when this variable **is not** greater than 100. An "if statement" was add to stop the loop when the variable comes to zero. The using of reserved word `break` is restricted to `while` and `for` loops.

## 3.2. Packing

When we are creating an app, we will create some features in this. So, it is almost always a good practice to create **modules** separated from the main script. It improves the organization and maintainability of our code.  
To use those modules that have been written outside, we need to **import** them on the main script. But, to import them in the main script, we need to export that module to be imported where we want. Let's see an example below:

```javascript
let numberArray = [];
function creatingRandomNumbers(n1, n2) {
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        let number = Math.floor(Math.random() * (n2 - n1 + 1)) + n1; //floor will round the random number, since "random" only generates numbers between 0 and 1 (1 excluded). The n2+1 is to include the n2 in the range of random numbers; +n1 ensures that the range will be between n1 and n2, and not between 0 and 10; n2-n1+1 is to ensure how many integers will be between n1 and n2. For example, if n1=10 and n2=20, 20-10+1=11, i.e., we have 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20.
        numberArray[i] = number;
    }
    return numberArray;
}

function returningEvenNumbers() {
    let numberList = creatingRandomNumbers(1, 1000);
    console.log(`The list of numbers is ${numberList}`);

    let sumOfEvens = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < numberList.length; i++) {
        if (numberList[i] % 2 === 0) {
            sumOfEvens++;
            console.log(`${numberList[i]} is even.`);
        } else {
            console.log(`${numberList[i]} is odd.`);
        }
    }
    console.log(`The list of numbers has ${sumOfEvens} even numbers.`);
}
```

Above, I created a script with two functions (or modules): one to generate a list with 10 random numbers from a range defined by me, and one to check and return whether a number is odd or even. Let's imagine that these functions were created in a script called "checkingNumbers.js", but I want to use at least one of these modules in another program/script. To do so, we need to add a line of code in the script "checkingNumbers.js" to export the modules.

```javascript
module.exports = { creatingRandomNumbers, returningEvenNumbers };

/* We write like above nowadays, but in the past:
module.exports = {
  creatingRandomNumbers : creatingRandomNumbers,
  returningEvenNumbers : returningEvenNumbers
}; */
```

Now, if you want to use "creatingRandomNumbers" module in another script/program, you use the reserved word **"`require`"** in the file in which you want to use the module.

```javascript
const randomList = require("./checkingNumbers");

console.log(randomList.creatingRandomNumbers(1, 100));
```

I created a variable to import the modules from the script "checkingNumbers.js". I used the reserved word **"`require`"** and gave a string with the location of the script as argument. Then, I used the module "creatingRandomNumbers" to create and print on the screen a list with 10 numbers.

## 3.3. **Let's practice!**

-   Practice 10: Create a program to calculate the multiplication table of a number.

-   Practice 11: Create a program that runs through a list of numbers to return only the even numbers in this list.

**You can find practices' solutions [here](/README.md)**.
